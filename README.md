# Connect Four AI
Project was completed for CS 570 Artificial Intelligence at University of Idaho.

## Abstract
The aim of this project is to implement an AI that plays Connect Four against
a human opponent. This program uses the minimax search algorithm to make 
sure the AI blocks potential winning moves by the opponent, and that it always
makes a winning move if one is available. Moreover, the program uses the alpha
beta pruning algorithm to make sure that the AI doesnâ€™t take a long time to make
a move. I ended up with good results as the AI chooses its moves correctly, and
in a fast manner. 

## Algorithms: 
* Minimax Search Algorithm
* Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm

## Game Play 
 To make this game entertaining, I randomized who starts first. Shown below
 are different scenarios of the game play, where 1 is the human opponent piece, 2
 is the AI piece, and 0 is the blank pieces. The depth used for this game play is 5.
