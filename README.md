# Connect Four AI
Project was completed for CS 570 Artificial Intelligence at University of Idaho.

## Abstract
The aim of this project is to implement an AI that plays Connect Four against
a human opponent. This program uses the minimax search algorithm to make 
sure the AI blocks potential winning moves by the opponent, and that it always
makesawinningmoveifoneisavailable. Moreover,theprogram uses the alpha
beta pruning algorithm to make sure that the AI doesn’t take a long time to make
a move. I ended up with good results as the AI chooses its moves correctly, and
in a fast manner
